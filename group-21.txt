File structure make the structure obvious
Smart devide into primary and backup, and let its client relate to both
Main file should not be only function call
Good naming, in ...Main, easy to see functionality in select statement
Everything happens from the perspective of this select case, very easy to follow
Great coherence and completeness, modules seems to do exactly what it is supposed to
Alsmost every function is pure, doing what it is supposed to (maybe except event_primaryAlive)
Very easy to follow structure, and relatively easy to follow
Naming smart with event, but some comments to maintain
Sometimes switching between camelCase and snake_case is arbitrary
